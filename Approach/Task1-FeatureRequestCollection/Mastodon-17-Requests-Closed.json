All the links posted by@Gargronare resolved. @Gargron What Play Store & Apple Store did makes no sense & so does the reasons provided. If paedophiles watch child porn on chrome browser/safari in their mobiles (which they do), are Google/Apple going to remove these browsers from the store? Browser is just a client. It has no obligation to spy on users as to what content they are watching (if it spies, no one will use it even for legitimate purpose, let alone pedos). This client app is just a tool to connect to any mastodon server & load content. Since the app got no control over the servers (nor should it), there is no good reason to ban official Mastodon app, let alone other clients. Here are my reasons why they cant ban this app for meeting basic expectations What Apple & Google did makes no sense (explanation above)Since mastodon has good visibility now, there will be tremendous public pressure to back offMany lawyers would be willing to fight against unjust ban (if Big Tech bullies bans) What Apple & Google did makes no sense (explanation above) Since mastodon has good visibility now, there will be tremendous public pressure to back off Many lawyers would be willing to fight against unjust ban (if Big Tech bullies bans) These Big tech bullies must have assumed people wont complain if they bully app developers (which they know they can do, thanks to \"legal\" monopolies they have which they ensured thru bribes to politicians to not break these monopolies), but since mastodon is mainstream app, they cant bully that easily now. Incase of twitter, the data is stored on twitter servers. So, Apple & Google can bully. But incase of mastodon, the app has no business to know which instance its talking to & what content is being stored in it. So, this app cant be held liable to for any harmful content. If issue is the threat of banning (which imo is not a legitimate concern), why not publish multiple versions of app to playstore, where new development happens on a canary version (to test waters in playstore with all experimental features), while main app is still available for download incase if canary version is banned (unlikely)? & also publish same canary version to non-google repos too, but still certified by repo maintainers to be malware free, so people can still install it if BTB take it down & the issue is being litigated, people can still download feature rich app?
