In analyzing the annotated feature request corpus, we note 103 disagreements between two annotators. 

| Disagreement Class                | #       |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
|  Human Error (Background/Fatigue) | 40 / 29 |
| Referential                       | 16      |
| Incorrect Labeling                | 6       |
| Intro of New Heuristics           | 6       |
| Language Error                    | 3       |
| False Extension                   | 1       |
| Technical Term                    | 1       |
| Formatting Issue                  | 1       |

- Human Error: Discrepancies arose from occasional human oversights. Fatigue, cognitive load, and the repetitive nature of annotation tasks sometimes led to missed or inconsistent labeling by both annotators. Human error was the primary cause of disagreements, accounting for 69 instances. 
- Referential: Pronoun references such as "it" or "they" were a frequent source of interpretational differences. For example, one annotator may have understood a pronoun to refer to a specific component or module within the software, while the other interpreted it differently, given the pronoun's vague or multi-faceted context. 16 instances of disagreement fall into this category.
- Incorrect Labeling: Some disagreements occurred because ambiguity and incompleteness were mistaken for each other, leading to mislabeling. For example, one annotator might label a vague statement as ambiguous, while another sees it as incomplete or lacking detail. This also includes cases where an annotator, being overly cautious, tries to find alternative interpretations, extending ambiguity beyond its intended scope. Six instances of disagreement fall into this category. 
- Intro  of New Heuristics: During the discussions among the annotators, an annotator would propose a new heuristic is required to properly categorize an ambiguity, which is logged as a type of disagreement. Six instances of disagreement were noted due to the introduction of these new heuristics.
- Language Errors: The linguistâ€™s background in language analysis led to frequent identification of issues like misspellings, grammatical errors, and unclear sentence structures. These language-related errors, while sometimes inconsequential to the feature request's functionality, impacted the interpretation of meaning and, thus, the annotations. Three instances of disagreement fall into this category. 
- False Extension: Disagreements arose when an annotator misinterpreted the content and extended the annotation beyond its intended scope. This led to one instance of disagreement among the annotators.
- Technical Terms: The annotators' backgrounds led to different interpretations of specialized SE terminology. The software engineer naturally understood technical terms and applied this domain knowledge in the annotation. In contrast, the linguist found these terms ambiguous, lacking the specific technical frame of reference to interpret or annotate them accurately. One instance of disagreement fall into this category. 
- Formatting Issue: Due to the nature of web scraping, some HTML elements were also scraped in the feature requests that were annotated. This caused one instance of disagreement in annotation among the annotators.
