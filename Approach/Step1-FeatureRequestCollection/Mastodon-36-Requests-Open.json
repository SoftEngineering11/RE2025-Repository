The more people I have on the app, the more posts show up... and that means there's almost always a \"load more\" button. Therefore, the app doesn't keep its position as much as it used to. It's probably the same for everyone who is now following a lot of people. FWIW: I've tried a number of apps over the past few days as a result and Fedilab (free on F-Droid, but also for pay on the Google Play Store) is the only one that seems to keep a timeline position. Sadly, it's not as polished as the Mastodon app (although it does have more features). This lack of reliable timeline remembering is really the main thing that's now keeping me away from the official Mastodon app, sadly.
