Lets say you are getting a Signal message on your mobile. You select the notification message, switching to your Signal app, opening the conversation. You now see the last part of the conversation dialogue between you and this single person. You now answer the message of that person, writing things that are meant to be read only by that single person. Just after sending the message (or never?) you realize that you just sent this message to a group chat of many people whose conversation happens to be filled with messages of you and the other person  as long as your screen view/history is showing.  Therefore, you accidentally sent a personal message to a group conversation.  You assumed, that you wrote your message in a private conversation because you have seen only one person's answers. Other people did not write for a longer period of time to that group conversation. You could have read the header information where you could have seen that this is not a person-to-person conversation.

The ability to change/overwrite the background color of group chats to an alarming red one for example could give the user a hint that this is not a personal conversation but a group chat. However, there is still the issue that Signal might give away \"red\" for an arbitrary personal conversation but this only leads to you looking more closely to the header, realizing that it is save to write personal stuff in this conversation.

The term push-to-talk appears in #3563 but that issue seems to be about sending voice messages, and the way this feature is currently implemented is not the way the term PTT is commonly used.

PTT conversations could be left open for days or months, and at any given time no data is necessarily being transferred unless someone has their thumb on the PTT button.  Why  PTT is a love-it or hate-it kind of feature. For me, it would be a major selling point that I could use to get a few more people onto Signal.

Here's a draft sketch for how I imagine this working:  In order to be able to be heard live, the caller needs to first initiate a conversation through the menu in the SMS thread. When off, the interface would look and work exactly as it does currently, except for the new menu option to start a PTT conversation. The callee would accept the conversation either through a notification or an indicator in the SMS thread.  When a PTT conversation is active, the microphone icon would change to indicate that holding it will stream audio live, and a menu item for muting the conversation would be enabled. The three PTT conversation states would be active, muted, and off, with the only shared state being whether the conversation is active or not. When the user mutes a conversation, no indication is sent to the other party.  So long as the conversation is active, all incoming audio would be saved as audio messages the same way they currently appear in the SMS thread. When muted, the audio would not play until the user specifically listens to it. When unmuted, it would play live through the speaker phone.

But the limit of only up to one week, makes it rather un-useful, as one might often need to refer to messages from more than a week or two ago; e.g. \"When did we decide to meet?\", \"He sent his address when we planned it a couple of weeks ago\".

In most cases, we have no use for the messages after a few months, and thus in the name of privacy, it would be nice to know that everything you have said won't be captured for ever and ever, when we already have the feature needed, and can get there with the addition of extra options.

The dissapearing messages already achieves exactly this privacy issue - except of the unfortunately short duration. The options of a few minutes is great for highly sensitive content, but one week is too short for most practical conversation, when thinking about Signal as a general conversation platform.

Sending each person an invite individually is out of the question. So\u2026 I think you need to think about how to get users inviting others. You can test different messages and see what works best. Also, the drawback of this approach is that it only works for people who\u2019ve set textsecure as their default SMS app. Another approach would be to let people send messages to non-users, such that the user receives a notification that they have messages waiting but has to install textsecure to see their messages. I don\u2019t have any sense of how hard this is to do. But this might be better a better approach, since it works for users who don\u2019t have textsecure as their default app, and because there\u2019s a really compelling reason for the user to install, in that moment. The workflow for somebody looking to start a private conversation becomes simpler, too. \u2013Holmes On Jun 22, 2015, at 7:42 AM, oaimnotifications@github.comwrote:I think it would be enough to append a message saying \"Sent with Textsecure: [link]\"People would become curious and may give it a try\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub#3446 (comment).

It is nearly never helpful to know that one random person in a group has read the message. At a very high level, to me blue check marks mean that the recipient has read the message in a one-to-one chat, so they should mean that the recipients have read the message in a group chat. On WhatsApp, I find this feature very helpful -- if a message has blue check marks then I know everyone has seen it and I no longer need to think about it. If an important message does not have blue check marks then it is intuitive to me to go into the details and see which people have received and which have not. On Signal, it is much more difficult because the blue check marks do not tell me anything useful. The marks go blue nearly instantly as one member reads them from then on there is no visual indicator that all people have seen it, so I need to go into the message details over and over until I see the relevant person has read it. I appreciate that there is an additional complexity in Signal because read receipts are optional (read receipts are always sent for group chats in WhatsApp), but I feel like this should at least work as expected where all users have read receipts turned on.

Every one of my not so technical friends ask me why he can't search his messages. The Brown University has an interesting approach to handle this. Thanks to jaypatelani on the community forum, we know that there is some possibility to search in signal messages without compromising security and without doing major changes to the signal infrastructur. http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/signal/ http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/signal/ In this project, we set out to explore whether encrypted search could be used to add search functionality to the Signal messaging app securely and without compromising efficiency. The design we proposed incurs minimal changes to Signal's current architecture and has several advantages over the naive solutions which include using a plaintext in-memory index or using full-database encryption solutions like SQLCipher.

And my personal most anticipated feature that would come as a side effect of this: In the future, we plan on improving the project in two ways. First, we would like to store EDB and message encryption keys in either the Android Key Store or, depending on the device, in secure hardware. The benefit of this would be that the encrypted index would be secure even while the app is in open mode.Second, we would like to use encrypted search techniques to also hide some of the meta-data that Signal currently stores in plaintext like timestamps, sender and device ID.

If you press the back button in an app (or press an \"exit\" button which most likely does the same thing as pressing back), you're not going forwards. You're goingbackwards.

If that is not the case and we consider manual key comparison something every user should do, we have to find a solution that let's them know they should do it. My point is that the average user hasno ideathat those are two different properties which in combination give the user different levels of security (from beeing owned).To the user it doesn't matter, if he gets hurt because somebody listened in to his conversations or because somebody impersonated who he wanted to talk to - the worst case is the same. no idea  Nobody who understands the differences is not mislead - they know what both things mean and might be a little annoyed that we didn't differentiate them as clearly as possible.But those that don't know that there is even a difference know that yellow is not as \"good\" as green. If they have no contacts with a checkmark to begin with, they won't even know that there could be one. I'm sure they would notice the difference, and with apps like skype, where the badge/checkmark just appears that's just fine.In TS however you would have to actively go to some hidden menu to make the badge appear.   I wanted to force these two things into one icon, because we need a way to let the user know that, even when it's encrypted, he can do better. I proposed the combination of color and lock, because it conveys the message well (every non-geek I talked to loves Threema for that).But if we find a method that works equally well to indicate that they can do something to improve their safetyandmake nerds like myself happy, I'm sold!  and To do that we may put a badge with a crossed out checkmark or a greyed out checkmark next to all non-validated TS users. 3. The most important color is redThe only thing I'm very sure about is, that we have to make it as clear as possible when the user is going to send an unencrypted SMS.We want the layperson to think about TextSecure as thesecuremessenger - aka \"everything I do with the app is safe\".Unencrypted SMS break this paradigm and nobody ever checks if the little black lock is there or not.Right now we just remove the lock when writing unencrypted. We don't even change the lock symbol by opening it.From a design perspective this is the worst thing we could do. 3. The most important color is red   secure    That is why I am positive we should have an open lock in the color every user associates with the necessity tostop:  red.Traffic lights, stop lights, beetles and mushrooms have burned it into everybody's brain that they have to stop in their tracks and think what the hell they are about to do. stop  4. The color vision impaired(I was to lazy to type that up again and copied it from one of my other posts).Bringing color blind people up is a valid point, but we can not make design choices for a small minority, that will negatively impact the usability for the huge majority.If you argue like that, we also shouldn't use the green/blue color scheme to indicate the transport channel, because there aren't just red/green color vision impaired people.I think we should really consider adding a third theme in addition to the light and dark ones, with high contrasts and/or different shapes.This is supposedly a positive example:http://wearecolorblind.com/example/ichat/ 4.

So they're not interested in seeing, all the time, during the chat, who is verified and who isn't.  What they're interested in is getting a list of people whom they need to verify with, in this chat.

Maybe we can make this part of#838, but personally I think that encryption and trust should work the same for all users. The trust indicator is a core part of the security model and there should not be any ambiguity as to why some people see the questionmarks and others don't. need #838 Just a short example:In the years of the Mexican drug war since 2006, hundreds of journalists have been tortured, murdered and dismembered by the cartels, because of their work.  An incomplete list of 134 victims is here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Mexico#During_the_Mexican_Drug_War  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Mexico#During_the_Mexican_Drug_War But if you search for mexico journalists and killed you will find a lot more details you probably never wanted to know.And the cartels are not some technology impaired gangsters. One of the most powerful cartels was founded by a big group of previous elite military members and they kidnapped dozens of engineers to build them their own, unsurveillable cellphone network, spanning whole regions of the country.  Why am I saying this? I don't want to be rude, it's not my intention to belittle anybody or their opinion. But I want to make very clear that we are living in a secure bubble, where privacy of communication is a nice-to-have feature, not something that's essential to our survival. We are so used to be able to voice our opinions about whatever we care about, that we are simply not aware of the brutal realities many people have to live in.But our decisions on these topics still influence the security of people all around the globe.  Don't understand me wrong - I'm all for maximizing usability and ease of use. If crypto isn't easy to use, nobody will use it and then it doesn't help anybody. But in this case I think the small potential of slightly annoying some people is worth the security all users get from this.And as I already said - all the Threema users I know love the trust indicator (which is way more agressive than our little grey questionmark) and say it feels like a game to get as many trusted contacts as possible.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@Lindworm @Lindworm Non-TS contacts get no badge at all, because they can't even encrypt the session.And the badge is a symbol of the trust in that the person of the other end of your encrypted session is actually only the person you want to talk to.

Then the user would have to decide which colour means which. To make sure he doesn't mix up colours he can always look at the locks and badges and that's really the point. The usage of colours as it is now being probposed by your screenshots is redundant, many people probably don't even like the colours and colour blind people maybe even have difficulty in distinguishing between the green and the grey that one of the screenshots uses. In my opinion the technical side and the aesthetical side should be separate. This also means that I would not distinguish between transportation. One colour for everything. Except maybe for a red lock or other indicator-symbols that signal danger. But again there is the problem with colourblind people. @virtualritz UI inconsistencies We have three areas that lack consistency: contact listconversation listmessaging window contact list conversation list messaging window How does the scheme your screenshots show translate into the scheme for the contact list? Right now the contact list only has a green vertical bar if you are a TS user. What's missing there are at least the avatars. We probably still want to show who is using TS and who is not, but which graphical means will we use for that? The lock comes to mind. Furthermore we probably want to show who is being trusted and who is not, so we need another symbol or some combination of symbols. On the contact list there is an additional problem: contacts have more than one number, so those symbols need to be shown next to the number that is registered with the TS-server. The problem here is which symbol(s) we use for all this. In the messaging window your screenshots show a combined lock and verification badge. I'm asking myself if we could use this symbol on the contact list as well or if it would be to small so visually impaired people would not be able to see which status their contact has. The locks on the texts are already too small. These locks don't get bigger if you increase the text size. So what I'm proposing is to use the same symbols throughout all these three different spots in the UI. Unless there are mockups for all of them and they have been discussed by everybody, I don't think there should be made changes to just one of the three. An OT question Threema uses the red dot to show to the user if somebody contacts them who has their number but whose number is not in the contact list of the user. Is this scenario even possible with TS? Is it correct that I won't be able to communicate over TS if not both contacts have each other's number?

Threema's messages don't even have colours, although I think coloured messages give better structure. All I can say now is that we are free to use the colours we want. We wouldn't even have to take iMessage as our example. https://lh5.ggpht.com/BFS5-o8Rt3caPj9wWfMfpiVz-X8KI5nKcV9CLRSDyMzbwf3xqFGhj99oJ2Ic46hkXJ4=h900 Threema uses three colors to combine encryption and trust.

But we have one level more that we need to convey, because TS also supports unencrypted SMS. Threema uses three colors to combine encryption and trust. But we have one level more that we need to convey, because TS also supports unencrypted SMS. This is how Threema's system works: Level 1 (red): the ID and public key have been obtained from the server because you received a message from this contact for the first time. No matching contact was found in your address book (by phone number or e-mail), and therefore you cannot be sure that the person is who they claim to be in their messages. Level 2 (orange): the ID has been matched with a contact in your address book (by phone number or e-mail). Since the server verifies phone numbers and e-mail addresses, you can be reasonably sure that the person is who they claim to be. Level 3 (green): you have personally verified the ID and public key of the person by scanning their 2D code. Assuming their device has not been hijacked, you can be very sure that messages from this contact were really written by the person that they indicate. My thoughts: It is true that TS can send secure SMS. But from my point of view we could easily say that unencrypted SMS from sombody on your contact list or somebody not on your contact list are almost equally bad as receiving encrypted SMS from somebody not on your contact list. As far as I know impersonating somebody via SMS is pretty easy so even if there is encryption the security is bad. I'd say those cases are all only worth a red dot. Unverified contacts which are already on your contact list get two orange dots, regardless of transportation. Verified contacts get three green dots, regardless of transportation. Did or forget a use case? Does this schema somehow make sense? Color vision impaired people will have a hard time to distinguish between the colors. At least between red and green. But there are also other kinds of color blindness. Color vision impaired people will have a hard time to distinguish between the colors. At least between red and green.

Maybe we can now discuss this option as well and get closer to a decision.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "Hey Budies! Great topic! My 2 cents: Channel (encrypted) != Contact (trustable): Channel (encrypted) != Contact (trustable) I really think it's important to differenciate the two concepts that@virtualritzinsists to do: one thing is if the next message to be sent will be encrypted, or not; other thing is if the contact is trustable, or not. The idea of to aggregate a 'checked' or a 'doubt' small icon next the name of the contact, sounds great to me. In time: trustable, or not trustable, is the contact, not the connection, it's because I think better is this icon be next the contact name, and not next the lock icon. @virtualritz Colors: Colors I don't think that a salad of colors signifying diferent concepts is a good strategy of communication. Here, I agree with the idea that less is more. It's enough to use the green x blue colors paradigma to significate SMS or PUSH channels, don't? I really believe that a clear interface is better that one with lots of informations embebbed on it. Checked and interrogations icons, doesn't depend of collors to communicate. Likewise, closed and opened locks are enough to communicate about if the channel is encrypted or unencrypted. Even PUSH (blue) and SMS (green) channels would not depend of collors in the respective messages to communicate it. Don't use collors as much as possible could make the interface clean, I guess. SMS or PUSH choice != Encrypted or Unencrypted choice: SMS or PUSH choice != Encrypted or Unencrypted choice There is a thing (maybe an architectural problem to be solved) with the next message to be sent that, I believe, should be looked carefully. See that one thing is if the next message will be sent over SMS or PUSH channels. Other thing is if the next message will be encrypted or unencrypted. All we know that via PUSH channel it will be always encrypted, and that the PUSH channel just can be used between TextSecure users with PUSH mode on. The problem I believeprecedes the choice of the send icon design(the plan paper with/without padlock closed/open etc.). precedes the choice of the send icon design Currently, there is an arbitrarily predetermined hierarchy of ways to send a message: PUSH Encrypted > SMS Encrypted > SMS Unencrypted. The user doesn't have the option to choose it! Every regular user of WhatsApp or Telegram knows that his PUSH message just will be read when the destinatary connects to Internet, and that if he wants his important message fall '''immediately''' on destinatary mobile, the better channel is not PUSH, but SMS. I would strongly advocate that the TextSecure user should have, himself, the possibility to choose the channel he will use and, obviously, if it is SMS, the option to choose diminish the security to an unencrypted message. Possible solutions to it should be two icons (one to SMS other to PUSH); a pop-up with the possible choices, etc. It's not acceptable to a SMS regular user don't have his message immediately delivered to the destinaraty mobile because TextSecure choosed to send over PUSH channel, even if the recipient (we are talking about both TextSecure users, of course) is and will be offline for the next year... =) Buddies, thanks for all the great job!

In general, relying on lots of colour distinctions is not a good design choice in my opinion, not just because of colour blindness (I have red-green deficiency for example), but because of overall busyness when too many colours are made to bear meaning. If colour is used, I think there needs to be another visual cue (which makes it even busier).

Downloading the whole namecoin blockchain is out of the question on mobile devices. As is relying on just querying a full node.Because we only need the identity information, it should already be a lot lighter than the whole namecoin blockchain, even without doing something akin to SPV or pruning. @rxl    But until a client or a library exists, which can simply be queried from the app that needs to verify the identity, I think this is unfortunately not a viable approach.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "I'd check out dnschain (https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain). https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain Here is an API endpoint where you can query for my data using dnschain:http://dns.dnschain.net/u/ryanshea http://dns.dnschain.net/u/ryanshea", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@rxlYeah, I already looked at dnschain.

I think electrum has proven that you can have a very high level of reliability/trust while still having only a few entities host their own nodes.

If you know that corp A, corp B, org C and org D all run nodes, you can query 2/4 or 3/4 of them and have a high level of confidence that the answer you're receiving is correct. The other option is of course SPV. IMO the long term model will be a hybrid of the electrum \"few nodes\" model and the multibit SPV model.

I agree that it's usually more important to to communicate to the user if his conversations are private than if he has to pay a few cents for each message. But the state of encryption is generally not going to change during the conversation, while the transport does change dynamically and may do so several times a day. If we do it, I'd propose to use red and green for encrypted and unencrypted messages respectively, for the reasons we already discussed. In an encrypted conversation the green color will probably positively reinforce the user, to use encryption whenever possible.The question is, if the red will do the opposite for people chatting unencrypted.In the short term this kind of nagging will certainly make users try to get it to green by convincing friends and family to switch to TS. But most users will have only a few TS contacts. If they use TS as their main SMS app, like I do, they will have many more unencrypted conversation full of glaring red \"stop signs\". That may discourage people more than a little red lock on the send icon ;-).   But I guess we can't solve all problems at once.

In terms of communicating if the message is sent over SMS or over PUSH, there needs to be a decision if it is a characteristic users WANT to know. Asking users is a good way. :) Get a simple survey together and ask TextSecure users to fill it out. Provide it in anonymous form. I\u2019d happily help put it together.

However, if I am a user in the US and SMS costs a lot, and I have a data plan, then maybe I want to know.

Mandatory and highly prominent security icon in a non-color-changing send icon Optional transport iconopposite the send iconif SMS will be used. opposite the send icon Yes, I understand this could mean ::gasp:: up tothreeicons in every historical message. I'd be happy with that, because I believe each one would be easily understood by users, and far easier to differentiate than colors which follow few conventions other than stoplight colors. It's also good for color-blind folks. And, you can assimilate it in a glance. three If number of icons on the screen/scroll buffer is for some reason a problem, use a single graphical element to display the various states. Security has up to 3 states (insecure, secure, and secure-trusted). Return-receipt has up to 3 states (awaiting receipt, receipt confirmed, receipt unconfirmed). Data transport has 2 states (SMS or not present). Thus you need 3 * 3 * 2 = 18 total combinations which could be something like a PNG or SVG displayed as a single element on each historical message.", "Images: ": ["https://camo.githubusercontent.com/415e03688a5e21f7a5829b929317b1ca1527c2ed/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f363739373934332f323330333730362f34636135396564322d613164652d313165332d393639312d3464653461353863646331372e6a7067", "https://camo.githubusercontent.com/247c72480354c91a7180aad6d65586c27245df3f/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f363739373934332f323330333730382f35376436336165362d613164652d313165332d386366622d6237323432343836626234622e6a7067"]}, {"Text: ": "Hello, as already mentioned in: #2774 #2774 I think the message bubble colors should not be used to indicate what messaging channel (Data/SMS) is being used or if the message is encrypted or not or if the message has arrived or not.

Slighly (it doesn't need to go fully blue or green, I think).  @Lindworm This ticket is not about other parts of the UI. Just thesendbutton. send If you think there is need to also convey the trust level with the other party in a conversation, I really suggest to open a new ticket for this.Because there will be lots of suggestions where this information is best placed, thesendbutton, top bar or avatar just three possible.  send There is now a new ticket,#910for this issue. #910", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@virtualritzI've been writing on this too long so your new post appeared before I could send mine.I'll send my answer here, because I think the same iconography should be used for the lock on send iconandthe top bar icon. I also answer some points you raised that aren't connected to the top bar icon. I'll dive into the discussion about at the new ticket#910you just opened. @virtualritz   and #910 I understand the two different symbolisms I want to combine into one icon.But the layman doesn't know about the differences between trust and encryption - and they shouldn't have to! Also because the contexts in which they are used are so similar, there will never be any confusing cases.  lock is closed and green -> extremely secure (encrypted and manually verified)lock is closed and yellow/black -> very secure (black is be better to underline that it is already secure because TS did a modified DH exchange, yellow to highlight that you are safe but can improve it with one more step)lock is open and read -> unencrypted SMS meanyou are not safewatch out what you write lock is closed and green -> extremely secure (encrypted and manually verified) lock is closed and yellow/black -> very secure (black is be better to underline that it is already secure because TS did a modified DH exchange, yellow to highlight that you are safe but can improve it with one more step) lock is open and read -> unencrypted SMS meanyou are not safewatch out what you write you are not safe There will never be something like closed red lock -> ???open green lockopen yellow/black lock closed red lock -> ??? open green lock open yellow/black lock The wayI understoodyour previous post was that you were concerned about two color sets used to indicate the two (three if you really want to) different properties (securityandtransfer channel) of the conversation.And to make that distinguishable I proposed the help and using two easily distinguishable shades of green.Even with only one color set we should have a help section. Thefirstthing my mom asked me after she installed TS was, what the difference between the blue and the green messages is. I understood security transfer channel   first Bringing color blind people up is a valid point, but we can not make design choices for a small minority, if those will negatively impact the usability for the huge majority.If you argue like that, we also shouldn't use the green/blue color scheme to indicate the transport channel, because there aren't just red/green color blind people.I think we should really consider adding a third theme in addition to the light and dark ones, with  high contrasts and/or different shapes.This is supposedly a positive example:http://wearecolorblind.com/example/ichat/    http://wearecolorblind.com/example/ichat/ I really like@Kiwii's idea to include a simple checkmark to the user pictures - but we'll have to make it look the same in the contact ist (#741), the message window and the contact keys page.If we do that to indicate trust, I think the send icon lock should be black most of the time but open and red when sending unencrypted SMS. @Kiwii #741", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "Why should a normal user not be able to understand this distinction. Surely, everyone understand the difference between speaking on the phone to someone you have personally met (and can identify by their voice, choice of words, accent etc) and speaking to a person you have never met or who isn't speaking in a distinguished enough way to be sure they are whom you think they were. The trust level is the analogy to that in chat. I am not at all against help. To the contrary. The message color confused me too, on 1st use of TS. But again, if a UX scheme needs help to be understood, it is maybe not that great a UX scheme to start with. Open lock and red can be misread as a double negative/ambiguous imho. As@Kiwiipointed out, the checkmark is used in other apps with huge user bases already. Why invent a new UX concept when there is a working one people recognize already? @Kiwii Also see my last comment in#741. #741", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@virtualritzThey will of course understand

I am sure you are right, this effect is real and would probably cost us a few users.But I am also sure that if we don't use a wide open red lock, there will be a few edge cases in which people get hurt, because they accidentally send something unencrypted that they shouldn't have.This probably sounds exaggerated but I am sure that it will happen, if TextSecure gets widely adopted.

One of the most basic rules of UI design is, that you can not take something away that you made people expect, by using something similar in it's place before The information \"this is not encrypted\" is a lot more important than the information \"this is not encrypted\". In the second case nothing bad can come from not knowing the state, in the first this may well happen.

It also doesn't stand out at all. We notice when we get shown color, movement or something new, but we don't notice when something that's been there a while is taken away.

An open padlock would make sense when the user expects encryption, but encryption for some reason is not present (this should never happen anyway), not when sending normal SMSes \"as I've always done it\". This of course applies mainly within the same app. Otherwise Apple would never have made OSX, because \"everybody knows the windows design\". You have to think about the average user. To them, TS is \"the incredibly secure chat app, that encrypts everything\" because their friend Johnny excitedly told them about it. They associate security with the app. And what they subconciously take away from that is \"everything I do with this app is encrypted/safe/private (it's all the same to them)\" So the expectation from a user perspective is that the normal case is secure, encrypted communication. And if we break this promise (his friend Johnny made), we just lost the users trust. The average user does not distinguish between things they do inside the same app, especially when the difference is only a tiny lock. The thing is that we have to convey this information, other apps don't. And with TS V1 you had to manually start a private session, so you didn't expect encryption if you did not initiate the session yourself. TS v2 however automatically starts encrypted sessions, both via data and via SMS.It just \"magically\" works.This way users expect whatever they write to be encrypted. Because we taught them.   It's also not importat for to know when it is encrypted, but it's very important to know when it's not encrypted.

Then your clock's interface is designed very badly. But there is a technical reason for that. It probably uses an LC display which can not show arbitrary shapes, because it doesn't have pixels. Instead the needed shapes are \"stamped\" onto the screen. That's done for two reasons:price and energy use. They could make a second icon, indicating \"alarm off\" but it can't be at the same position as the \"alarm on\" sign.They probably didn't want the user to be aware of the technical limitations (which could make him think they bodged it to make more cash) or confuse him with making the icon \"hop\" to a different place.   For the alarm clock it's also not that bad, because you usually only have to set it once on sunday and it automatically wakes you at the same time until you turn it off on friday.And if you look at your clock you already thought about setting the alarm.

Furthermore, the developers could have chosen to have an icon in the top bar notifying me about not having set an alarm. This is what I meant with my example. The specific clock I'm talking about is the Android clock app so both of your proposed reasons do not apply. Furthermore, the developers could have chosen to have an icon in the top bar notifying me about not having set an alarm. This is what I meant with my example. Alright, then I was confused. I somehow didn't catch the part where it said \"in the top bar\".I think the reason is probably twofold:Firstly top bar space is very valuable (many apps need it and there is just not much space) and showing it there would mean you'd have to actually run the program in the background, draining the battery.It would also be confusing because the top bar icons are very small and you can't convey much in grey on black in such a small icon. And both would have to look like a clock.You also have to show the symbol when active, because the app needs to run in the background and is required by Android to provide an icon for this (I think the latest versions may not be that strict about it anymore, but <4.2, maybe <4.3 they certainly are).So not showing the clock when active was probably not a choice for this, but instead for showing when active.      No, the user is taught that the process of encrypting is super simple as soon as the other party also has TS. This seems more like an issue with expectation management than with the current design. Maybe it's better to add something that creates other expectations than the ones you describe.My main point is that the user should only expect encryption when it is actually active, and at any point in a conversation where encryption has already been established, no unencrypted messages should at all be sent. Therefore open padlocks would be superfluous. No, the user is taught that the process of encrypting is super simple as soon as the other party also has TS.

My main point is that the user should only expect encryption when it is actually active, and at any point in a conversation where encryption has already been established, no unencrypted messages should at all be sent. Therefore open padlocks would be superfluous. My concern Is not really with the rare case that the encryption is for some reason not turned on any more, when it was before. (If one of the contacts just stops the private conversation while using SMS for example). The main problem will be that people quickly switch between many different conversations. And they won't memorate \"I have a secure session open with adam, pete, randy and carl, but use only sms with cherryl, homer, bart and lisa. Oh and my study group for economics uses insecure MMS, while my engineering study group uses secure push messages\". This is just not the reality. They will quickly switch between tabs and need a quick indication if the messages will be encrypted or not. However, I think this discussion will become a lot less important, if the prevalent proposal in#945, to use message colors to indicate encryption is actually used. A neutral grey or white will show non-encrypted conversations while a very toned down green indicates encrypted ones. You can also see some mockups I made over there. #945 If this happens, I think the lock over the send Icon should be black or grey, because it doesn't have to draw attention to itself any more.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "No punishment, we can also tone down the red.

That's a bit too much for me since it's nothing wrong with sending an unencrypted message to all the contacts that don't use TS (In fact, that's a common case). @mreppen: My point of view it that TS replaces the standard SMS/MMS app and offers substantial enhancements when texting with other TS users.

Rebuildung large groups whenever a member is supposed to leave, is not a viable option. Why can the creator of a group not hold some key locally that identifies him as administrator of that group? Whoever has the key can alter the group. If someone without admin status wants to add a member, an amdin has to approve it. If the key is lost, the group can no longer be altered. However, if all users leave a group, it will be closed. So you could give up a group, if that happens.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "Greetings. Really not sure about the logic in posting to a closed thread... This is a complicated concept.  I originally was going to just say, \"me too,\" but that obviously went out of control. I agree withgith-accountthat a central admin should be the sole person responsible for the thread/group.  The current solution of requiring members to unsubscribe or leave the group is not that great, but I understand the simplicity of it. gith-account As a safety, and to complicate things, there could be a mutiny feature, which would allow either a majority or a complete vote to \"kick\" the admin and assign a new admin.  The admin would not be allowed to vote.  This would also provide a backup if the admin loses their device, or just goes silent for an extended amount of time.  In situations where there is an even amount of recipients or voters and a tie occurs, an automatic re-vote would take place with a notification that there was a tie, then if the tie remains, no change would take place regarding the admin.  Any user, including the admin, could initiate a mutiny vote.  (Would be good if there was also the ability for the admin to voluntarily step down and assign a successor.)  All mutiny votes would require a single non-admin recipient be listed as the pending new admin.  The admin would not be kicked from the group following a successful mutiny, they would simply be demoted.  If the new admin decides to kick them, so be it. Something that would push into another feature request would be the ability to remotely destroy threads.  If a device is lost or stolen, then the authentication to remotely kill the old instance would be the private key (from a backup).  No backup, no remote kill.  Related threads:#1764,#5713,#643 #1764 #5713 #643 Group conversations would have to provide some type of secondary/tertiary key, unique to that thread.  The necessary portion of the key to authenticate would need to be sent to the admin of the group.  In a case of a mutiny, the keys would need to be regenerated by all members and passed to the new admin (the old admin would have bad keys and could be purged by the old admin when they next do a backup).  This key would obviously also have to be included in any backup done by the active admin.  (I am not sure how groups are currently encrypted ... using each recipients individual keys or by creating a new key ... if via a new key then a third key would be required for this feature.) I mention this remote kill feature because it is applicable to a group discussion in which sensitive information is shared, but a user is removed from the group, or a user loses their device.  This is also applicable for all recipients of a group that are kicked from the group.  The admin could then initiate a member validation check in which selected members optionally have their conversation history wiped, then are kicked from the group.  I say, \"optionally,\" to allow the admin the option to wipe their conversation or not, as sometimes it may be acceptable for the kicked recipient to retain the conversation history to that point.  If it is not acceptable for them to retain it, then the admin would make that decision when kicking them.  This could not be changed once the kick is completed.  Related threads:#5455,#5594 #5455 #5594 Oh yeah, the other aspect of group administration which is a wee bit frustrating is that anyone can force anyone into a group.  I would like for membership to be voluntary rather than mandatory.  Well, as I am typing this I just realized I have only added people to a group and have never been added to a group ... so it may be voluntary currently.  If not, see first two sentences of this paragraph.  :) With regard to non-admin's making kick requests, these can realistically just be done directly, outside of the group thread.  For instance, if USER1 wants to kick USER6, rather than create a new capability within the group administration for this type of request, USER1 could just directly communicate, outside of the group, with the ADMIN and say something like, \"Yo, USER6 is a lame anchor, I recommend you kick them.\" FWIW, i may be open to publishing this post in hardback for an early release next summer ....", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@TimesEnemyThat seemswaytoo complex, not only to develop but also as a Signal user.

That makes communication much more direct and lifelike.   To prevent timing attacks: Am I right that the receiver of the message can only be determined by the server? If true, the server could be configured to \"pulse\" out new messages only every 5 seconds.

My understanding of the app was that it would encrypt my SMS/MMS to contacts who also use Textsecure, and would otherwise use regular SMS/MMS.

I think the current setup process is very confusing to beginners. You can't assume that every user knows that TextSecure can be used as a SMS app and has a SMS fallback mode. Many assume that a messaging app sends everything over the air. Therefore it is necessary to point out how TextSecure actually works. Currently you have to give your friends a lengthy explanation that TextSecure can be used as an SMS app and how to configure TextSecure if the SMS fallback option is not suitable for them. At the moment the option to make TextSecure your SMS app is offered after you were asked if you want to import the SMS database. I think the proposal mentioned in#1065makes much more sense.

There are those normal users and whatsapp-renegades who are confused by the SMS feature and I had to send some of my friends textwalls of explanations of how to use this feature or disable it. Therefore the setup process and settings-page should be a bit clearer regarding this feature! At first I would let the user choose between the 'Push-Only-Setup' and the 'Complete-Package' - two huge buttons with a small explanation of the underlying features/costs. If the latter one is chosen one might import the existing sms database in a second step as well as setting up a possible notification about what to do, when push is unreachable. The setup page should represent these two options as well - 'Push-Service' and 'SMS-Options'. Hence I would move the upcoming message about setting up TS to the default SMS App into the SMS-Options-Tab. There you can also activate/deactivate the SMS fallback option as well as the only option which is missing (IMHO): a notification if the push-service cannot be used atm and if TS should take the SMS route or try again the push-service in a specific amount of time perhaps a notification if the push-service cannot be used atm and if TS should take the SMS route or try again the push-service in a specific amount of time perhaps The Push-only and SMS-only-users are obvious. Push is activated and the rest deactivated / SMS is activated and the notification is deactivated. The mixed-user who wants to use TS as SMS App with a little more control about sent SMS' can setup the notification when the push-service is unreachable atm. And the unbothered-user has push and sms fallback option activated and the notification is deactivated. now reconsidering I would suggest 3 options in the install process: Push-onlyLet me know when u send a SMSSend em all ;) Push-only Let me know when u send a SMS Send em all ;) edit: uups.

And they work pretty well, right? It is important to understand that SMS Fallback in a running conversation, and automatically switching to it, will only be useful in a very small fraction of cases. Wanting to use TextSecure as a really well-designed SMS/MMS app with secure storage of messages is a much more frequent use case, I would assume. So I would propose that the default behaviour of TextSecure should therefore be to use only Push for other known TextSecure+Push users, SMS+Encryption for other known TextSecure users who have Push disabled, and unencrypted SMS for contacts that my TextSecure has never had any kind of TextSecure key exchange with. This would also potentially solve#699: some users might only use TextSecure+Push, but not use TextSecure for SMS/MMS, and will then not accidentally be delivered encrypted SMS into a different SMS application just because the sender has enabled \"Fallback to SMS\". #699 Fallback to SMS should be triggerable by the user manually only by default: if I see the \"Sending...\" below the message, I can tap the message and select \"Send over SMS instead of Data\". Since the data message has apparently not reached the TextSecure server yet, we just cancel trying to send this message and send out an SMS with the same content instead then. Manually triggered. If a user has unlimited SMS, you can still give them another option for automatic fallback. This could be either implemented as a slider for the \"SMS Fallback\" preference (Off | Manual | Automatic), or you just leave the current option as-is to not confuse users, but stop greying it out and enable the behaviour I proposed in this post here when \"SMS Fallback\" is disabled while \"Use for SMS/MMS\" is enabled. What do you think? It would be asynchronous too, because the user sees whether the message is delivered and can take manual action. At worst, I can see the message being sent twice (once over push, once over SMS/MMS) in case it still gets delivered via data, but the receiving end could then perhaps detect this situation and not display the same message twice.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "I really like the idea of push and SMS being distinct and only falling back on SMS when explicitly specified.

Possibly registered with the central server (I assume that's how it figures out the v2 protocol currently). This way if a user who has sms as their default will generally receive messages over sms.

If you quickly check in on a (group) conversation with a lot of new messages, but don't have the time to read them all, it's certainly better to be able to mark everything from a certain message on as unread.The discussion I mentioned in my previous post was about the the UI implementation of unread messages and IIRC either@mcgintyor@moxie0mentioned that he preferred to automatically show to the last unread message instead of the last message received. @mejo-  @mcginty @moxie0 This may not be implemented yet, but to future-proof your PR the behaviour for normal unread messages and messages which have manually marked unread should be identical. This is not possible if you only mark the last message of a thread or the whole thread unread.You will either have to mark a single message unread or mark the specific message unread and all following messages too.  I prefer the variant where only one message is marked unread, because it improves the UX for more usecases.There are lots of different usecases, two of the more regular ones I can see are those:  The user receives a lot of notifications and checks into a thread, but doesn't have time to read them all. If I didn't get it wrong, TextSecure will (in the future) show the first unread message first. Thus the user has to mark the first message s/he wants to read later, because many messages were automatically marked unread, when the thread was openend and the user scrolled down to check how many messages there are. Unless a \"jump to the next unread message\" button is ever implemented (which is very unlikely because of the \"don't add new settings/buttons policy\"), this scenario should work well with both methods.The user marks a certain message unread because s/he wants to be able to quickly look up the information in this message. For example addresses, room numbers, meeting times, phone Numbers, flight numbers, names of conversation partners and so on.In this case the user only wants to read one message later, not the message and all following messages.

And they are unconnected, which means the police wouldn't even have found out about the other TS users (which probably also have something to hide)They would only have to bag them all and throw them into some dark hole. First because they don't know about the technology, and later because they found that, even if the people aren't connected to the original suspect, they still confess to a lot of \"crimes\" when interrogated, because they assume the police found out about their political activities and is interrogating them because of those, not some random message they don't even know they even received.And TS would pretty quickly be called a spy tool by the opposition, meaning that nobody will use it anymore.   How about putting nearby users in the same location bucket?Then we would have a database on the server connecting phone numbers to TextSecure users.That would mean not only the local cellphone provider and state could know who uses this \"subversive tool\" via DPI, but everybody who may compromise the servers.I don't think that's too bad, because the information is only critical for the local authorities, who can get them the old fashioned way, but we should consider it.

What happens when TS becomes popular in a region? What happens when TS becomes popular in a region? When we have a significant userbase (maybe 3-5%) of all users in a country with TS installed, we could then activate this feature for the \"paranoid\" users, and tell them about it. The jump in traffic would be obvious and police would pretty quickly be aware of this feature and that the people somebody texts often aren't connected to them in any way. Still, some people will get hurt, until the police understands this, but we at least minimized the effect. That there are now also lots of innocent people using TS won't mean the government doesn't put  them on a watch list, but the government probably doesn't have the resources to \"interrogate\" everybody.

On the included image you can see the  missed call lock screen missed call notification. The stock android SMS app had this same capability. It would be so sweet if TextSecure could do such thing.    Another missed feature of the stock android SMS app is the ability to reject calls with a text message all from within the lock screen.

There are other advanced options like this in TextSecure, but they're generally hidden away. Would this be better in advanced options (instead of SMS & MMS options), or maybe in a separate sub-category inside SMS & MMS options like the advanced MMS options (with a check box to turn them on)? It felt silly to add one for a single SMS preference, but that may be the best way. Let me know and I'll update the pull. Secondly, the default behavior should probably be that if the user \"empties\" the edit text and saves the preference as an empty string, it goes back to the default (unless we use the checkbox / subcategory idea above). It doesn't look like the other similar preferences do this (they're just regular edit preferences), but would this be something that might be good to implement (I suspect it would be useful elsewhere)? Finally, I made a new string resource for the default MMS user agent as it was used in several places (as a hint in the edit text pref and as the default value if persistence is disabled for some reason). I marked it as non-translatable, but this does add the ability to set different default MMS UA's for different locales.

If privacy is of concern you should password protect it, not having a password makes this accessable for anyone anyhow. Also you have the option to remove notifications, I guess the same could be done for lock screen widgets... The point of the lock screen widget is for the user to be able to see that you have a message, without unlocking the screen. It usually is a big and very clear icon indicating a new message, the content within the message doesn't necessarily have to be shown, just a indication of new messages would suffice, the notification should be big enough that you could see it from distance or for example while running, the small notification in the statusbar is hard to see while running. My understanding was that this app was trying to reel in novice users and to [some of] them (majority?), being able to see your message from the lock screen would be consider a good feature compared to the small icon indicator in the statusbar.
